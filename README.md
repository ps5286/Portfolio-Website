# Portfolio-Website
Udacity project
This project is part of Udacity's FEND Nanodegree.  This is the Portfolio website that includes a responsive design.  Those looking to use the site should download the project as a zip file and ensure that all files are part of the .zip and are all in the same directory when attemptin to use the files.  The files to be dowloaded are as follows: portfolio.html, styles.css, responsive.css, responsive2.css, and this Readme file.  The design of the website is such that it can be viewed on a laptop with the styles.css is the primary style, on a phone where the responsive.css is the style file, and on an iPad and an iPad Pro with responsive2.css.  The major differences is that the laptop style has more of a horizontal layout and the mobile styles use a vertical layout so there is no sideways scrolling, only vertical scrolling.
